## File Handling

The extension handles the following file-related operations:

-   **onDidCreateFiles**: Listens for the creation of new files and adds the signature text to them.
-   **addSignatureToFile**: Adds the configured signature text to the top of each new file.

## Deactivation

The extension's deactivate function is called when the extension is deactivated. However, since the extension primarily operates based on events triggered by file creation, there is no specific deactivation logic implemented.
