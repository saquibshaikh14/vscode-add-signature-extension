# Vscode Add Signature Extension
[![Visual Studio Marketplace](https://vsmarketplacebadge.apphb.com/version/saquibshaikh.vscode-add-signature.svg)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saquibshaikh.vscode-add-signature)

## Description
The Vscode Add Signature extension automatically adds a preloaded signature to the top of each file whenever it is created. Users can configure the signature text through the extension settings.

## Activation
The extension is activated when Visual Studio Code starts. It listens for the creation of new files and triggers the addition of the signature text.

## Configuration
* Open vscode **Command Pallet** by pressing cmd + shift + p in mac or cntrl + shift + p in window.
* Search `VscodeAddSignature: Configure` and open.

Configure the extension through the following settings:
- **Enable Add Signature**: Toggle to enable/disable adding the signature text to new files.
- **Signature Text**: Enter the signature text to be added at the top of each new file. Use `\n` for line breaks.

### Signature Text Example

Here's an example of how to format the signature text:
```javaScript
/**\n* author Saquib Shaikh\n* created on ${DD-MM-YYYY-hh-mm}\n* github: https://github.com/saquibshaikh14\n* copyright ${YEAR}\n**/
```

File output
```javaScript
/**
* author Saquib Shaikh
* created on 16-03-2024-10-30
* github: https://github.com/saquibshaikh14
* copyright 2024
**/
```

## Contributing and Bug Reporting
To contribute to the development of this extension or report any issues, visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/saquibshaikh14/vscode-add-signature-extensoin.git). Feel free to raise issues, submit pull requests, or contribute in any way you see fit.

## Known Issues
Untitled notes saving causes issues. If a file is saved and then shown as unsaved without modification, closing the file may result in the loss of changes.

### Limitations
- Files created using command line commands (`cmd`) will not trigger the `onDidCreate` event, and therefore the signature text will not be automatically added.

## File Handling
The extension handles the following file-related operations:

- **onDidCreateFiles**: Listens for the creation of new files and adds the signature text to them.
- **addSignatureToFile**: Adds the configured signature text to the top of each new file.

## Deactivation
The extension's deactivate function is called when the extension is deactivated. However, since the extension primarily operates based on events triggered by file creation, there is no specific deactivation logic implemented.
